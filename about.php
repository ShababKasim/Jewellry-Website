				<h4>About Us</h4>
				<img src="images/3.jpg" title="about" />
				<p>Jewellery Store is a third generation family business established in 1999. JS' founder learned his craft in his native city Indian centre of fine jewellery making. Today, Jewellery Store is one of India's premier and best-known jewellery manufacturers. We offer a full range of gold and platinum rings, necklaces, bracelets, earrings and pendants, set with diamonds and other precious stones, including ruby, sapphire and emerald.</p><br />
				<p>We have built the reputation on four pillars of strength: Style, Quality, Innovation and Price.</p>
				<p><h4><br>Style</h4></br>
<p>We believe jewellery is first and foremost a fashion item. A woman’s personal style is influenced by current fashion trends, and it is of paramount importance for leaders in the jewellery industry to stay abreast of those trends. Jewellery Store prides itself in its ability to translate the latest expressions of style, combined with good design principles, into its jewellery collections. At the same time, we have established what has become known as a uniquely Indian style, incorporating the best of European and American design to create a distinctive look that stands on its own merit.<p>
<p><h4><br>Quality</h4></br>
<p>JS's is a testament to our continuing and unwavering commitment to quality. In all aspects of our business, quality control is a continuous focus. Ultimately, it is our customers who dictate the level of our workmanship and whose ongoing input and feedback we value most.</p>
<p><h4><br>Innovation</h4></br>
<p>In every function within our company, we strive to lead and to adopt the best practices in the industry. We continuously develop and innovate through our own investment, giving our employees the tools and the training that will enable them to share in the company’s success. Ultimately, our people determine our ability to succeed.</p>
<p><h4><br>Price</h4></br>
<p>Jewellery Store consistently offers an extensive selection of fine quality jewellery at prices that represent exceptional value.
We are a premier company because we constantly and continuously strive to improve our product and our processes. We achieve our objectives by investing in our people, our processes and our technology. At a time when India is quickly emerging as a world leader in the supply of diamonds, Jewellery Store is positioned to participate this ascent by offering the best of what India has – quality, consistency and reliability.</p>
